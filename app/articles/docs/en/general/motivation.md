description: Motivation for the development of whitehat, an on-chain bug bounty protocol
---

## bounty protocol : but anonymous, fast and fair.

bug bounty protocols are bureaucratic and time-consuming for both parties involved, with risk of duplicated reports : often discouraging whitehats.

how can crypto fix this ?

- anonymity : pseudonymous identity (pubkey), confidential transfers, throwaway keys.
- faster : hackers submits a vulnerability, protocol validates it's legitimacy, hacker proceeds to hack, once validated
- fair : protocols set the percentage they're willing to pay

## anonimity

we believe privacy is a human right.

we'll never sell your data, and we despise companies doing so.

our protocol enforces privacy by using these following technologies :

1. ed25519 ecies [npm]() [github](): encrypt vulnerability report for a public key, decrypt with it's private key.
2. throwaway keys : you can send a message without exposing your public key (we create one on the fly).
3. confidential transfers (unimplemented) : darkfi profet 420 issou.

## faster process

You can combine Firebase products to build an eco-friendly, high-performance distributed system. It utilizes server resources only as needed, allowing for a very environmentally and economically friendly design.

The design and material costs of "predicting access loads in advance (design costs) and increasing server resources (material costs)" are no longer necessary, and concentrating more on things and developing is possible.

Furthermore, maintenance costs are significantly reduced. Post-release apps also automatically scale up computing resources to match user usage patterns. You don't need to worry about credentials, configuration, provisioning new servers, or decommissioning old servers.

Skeet is an open-source, full-stack serverless app development solution that makes Firebase and Google Cloud product combinations easier and easier to use.

Skeet CLI is not only for setting, deploying, and managing Firebase products but also for application development, such as VPN network settings, domain and name server settings, load balancer management security settings using Cloud Armor, and CI & CD using GitHub Actions. We provide that with a single command. Skeet supports everything from backend construction to front-end web, iOS, and Android development.

In addition, for more scalable and robust application development, we adopt tools useful for development, such as TypeScript, Jest, ESLint & Prettier by default. TypeScript is mainly used for ease of application creation, but it is also possible to build applications that partially utilize machine learning using Python.

By using Skeet, you can significantly reduce app development and maintenance costs and realize more plans.
